I have differetns projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/davidzuma?tab=repositories). Please, feel free to check them out, in this section I would not talk about every project but the ones I love more.

## Machine learning. Why do neural networks work?

The aim of this work is to study the idea about how neural networks ‚Äúuntangle‚Äù and ‚Äúflatten‚Äù the data, being able to accomplish complex tasks that other machine learning models cannot solve. First of all, we will study simple parametrization models such as lineal regression and logistic regression. Then, we will explore how neural networks can model data that simple parametrization models fail to do. Lastly, we will provide a geometric perspective that will help us to understand why neural networks are a successful choice to approach complex problems. You can find the code in [GitHub]([https://github.com/davidzuma?tab=repositories](https://github.com/davidzuma/Aprendizaje-Automatico-Medidas-De-Enredo)https://github.com/davidzuma/Aprendizaje-Automatico-Medidas-De-Enredo) and also as [Web](https://davidzuma.github.io/Aprendizaje-Automatico-Medidas-De-Enredo/) hosted using GitHub Pages.
